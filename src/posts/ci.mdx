# CI

## What is CI?

Continuous Integration is a development practice where developers regularly merge their code changes into a central repository. Each merge is then verified by an automated build, allowing teams to detect problems early.

## Why CI?

CI is a great way to ensure that your code is always in a working state. It also allows you to catch bugs early, and to make sure that your code is always up to date with the latest changes.

## How to setup CI?

There are many CI services out there, but we will be using [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) in this tutorial.
